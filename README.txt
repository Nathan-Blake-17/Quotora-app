This is the backend of my first mobile app - Quotora.

This app is available for download:
< https://gofile.io/d/Vv5FsO >

There are a few faults that need to be fixed as well as the design of the app. This is just making use of the bare basic features provided
 by the Kivy library. 

Further edits will be made the code is far from finished so if you are reading this then I haven't finished updating the code.

This project was made possible by a course on Udemy called "The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications" by Ardit Sulce.

I by no means declare this prject an original creation as I have followed the instructions of the tutor in the course. 

The only details that seperate my code from the tutors is the fact that I have followed an idea to use quotes from philosophers not based on
 feelings. 

To make more sense of this I suggest going to follow the course.

I thank the tutor, Ardit Sulce, for teaching me as well as many other people that have taken his course and some credit for the creation of
 this app should be given to him.

By no means is this app finalised I will be working on further developing this app to a point where it is a fully functioning original app.

Feel free to use this code as a guideline.

PLEASE NOTE: The hoverable.py file is not a result of my own code but code that I have been given access to by the tutor of the Udemy course
 mentioned above.

I DO NOT declare myself a master programmer I am still a beginner learning from other people!

I thank the reader as well for taking time to view my project and I hope you can leave feedback on this app if you like.

This README text file was written by the coder of this program Nathan Blake.
